I can’t find enough words to thank you for giving me the opportunity working for you in SAIB. I feel proud whenever I mention you as my manager for anyone outside the bank since you are a known name in our industry, being selected as a member of your crew is more than a QA-Pass stamp on my CV.

I am sorry to let you know that I will not continue the current engagement, and leaving the bank is one of the toughest decisions I had to make given the short period I had been here which didn’t allow me to explore the full potential of the position.

I have other plans that can be started in early March, and I am looking for your understanding to plan together the proper transition, while being committed to any required activities in the next few weeks. I am proposing end of Feb as my last day, while I am sure that we can find common ground if an extension is required from you or the bank side.

Thanks & best regards,
Essam
